										<p style="text-align:justify"> On Wednesday, September 18th, 2019 as part of <a href="https://ibm.biz/ai-research-week">IBM Research's
											AI week</a> we will be hosting the first workshop on <b>Neuro-Symbolic Computation and Machine Common Sense</b> (NSC-MCS).
										 </p>

										<p  style="text-align:justify"> Neuro-symbolic methods are relatively new in the DL community and at present, they are largely driven by the findings at the intersection of the fields of child-psychology, generative modelling and neuroscience suggesting symbol manipulation may be at the core of human common sense. This workshop will bring researchers from the aforementioned fields together with the highly diverse set of researchers in the wider fields of representation learning and reasoning in order to advance discussion and promote collaborations across its various subdomains, with a special focus on Neuro-symbolic AI and Neuro-Symbolic Computing and Machine Common Sense.

									<h2>ThreeDWorld Tutorial</h2>
									<h3>Researching Intelligence using Virtual Worlds</h3>

								ThreeDWorld (TDW) is a simulation framework that uses state-of-the-art video game technology to generate photo-realistic scenes in a virtual world. TDW’s flexible, general design allows researchers to collect next-generation experimental data and generate large-scale datasets for training AI systems with complete control over data generation and full access to all associated generative parameters.

									<h2>ThreeDWorld Use Cases</h2>

								</header>								
								 								
								<table style="float:center">
									<tr>
										<td>
											<h3>Use Case I</h3>
											The aim of our project is to understand the underlying neural computations involved in intuitive physics, i.e., common sense
											about physical interactions. We present video stimuli of physical events unfolding over time to rhesus macaques and compare
											the brain response (with fMRI and fMRI-guided electrophysiology) to intentional interactions versus purely physical interactions.
											Crucially, by using TDW to create parametric animations we will achieve unprecedented control over relevant physical properties
											(like magnitude and direction of force), which we can subsequently decode from neural activity using computational models.

											Ronald  is an Electrical Engineering and Mathematics student at Mercer University. He works on developing computational
											models of planning and decision-making with the Tenenbaum lab at MIT, investigating neural correlates of intuitive physics
											with the Freiwald lab at Rockefeller University, and control theory with the Thitsa lab at Mercer.
										</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>
											<h3>Use Case II</h3>
											Computer Vision researchers have limited control over various dimensions such as object size, angle, etc. in
											large-scale photorealistic datasets. Using TDW, we can generate extremely flexible and fully controlled datasets
											that allow for training models with transfer performances approaching those of photographic datasets such as ImageNet.									
											<br> <br><h3>Speaker</h3>
											<div class="image" style="float:left;width: 20%" align="center">
												<img src="images/tdw/martin_schrimpf.jpg" height="128"/>
												<div>Martin Schrimpf</div>
											</div>						
											Martin completed his Bachelor and Master degrees in Software Engineering in Germany at TUM, LMU and UNA, 
											conducting his Master’s Thesis on recurrent visual processing at Harvard with Gabriel Kreiman. 
											He has founded the non-profit startup Integreat and worked at Salesforce Research on deep learning for NLP 
											with Richard Socher before joining MIT’s Brain and Cognitive Sciences program for his PhD. There, he is 
											advised by James DiCarlo and works on evaluating and building neural network models of brain processing.
										</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>
											<h3>Use Case III</h3>
											Humans can readily interpret the sounds made when objects collide,
											scrape, and clatter against each other. We know little about how humans
											can make such inferences, nor can we replicate their success with
											machine hearing algorithms. We are building a perceptually inspired
											generative model of contact sounds, which can be interfaced with TDW to
											simulate sounds made by everyday objects.  We can use these sounds to
											study human perception of natural sounds.

													<img src="images/tdw/james_traer2.jpg" height="128"/> 
												<div>James Traer</div>
											</div>						
											James was formally trained as a physicist, and during his PhD work
											(Univ. of California, San Diego) he studied sound generation by ocean
											waves and developed algorithms to map the ocean and the Earth's crust
											with ambient sound. In 2013 he joined the
											McDermott Laboratory for Computational Audition (MIT) as a
											post-doctoral researcher. He has since studied how humans infer physical
											attributes of the world (e.g. source distance, room size, object
											material, force of impact) from the sounds made by everyday objects as
											they collide, scrape and deform.
